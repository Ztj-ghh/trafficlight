# trafficlight

This project aims to showcase a traffic light controller system, modelled as Moore state machine using VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) programming language. The traffic light controller system is implemented in a four-way intersection which consists of two major two-way roads in perpendicular with each other to control the movement of vehicles (assumed to be cars only).

For each intersection branch, there are four states pertaining to the traffic light system: red light state, first yellow light state, green light state, and second yellow light state. Therefore, there are a total of sixteen states incorporated into the traffic light system. The main challenge for the project was to implement what happens at each state given several restrictions - for instance, only one branch can have a green light at a time.

The traffic light system is fed three input signals: the two must-have clock and reset signals, as well as jam signal to indicate the current time of the traffic in hours, and in turn produce various major output signals: timer0 to timer3 signals to indicate the timing duration of the four states corresponding to the traffic light in the respective traffic branch, and greenlight, yellowlight, and redlight 4-element arrays to indicate in which traffic branches the corresponding traffic light is on - for instance, 0010 greenlamp value corresponds to green light on in the second traffic branch. Inside the traffic light system block, there are various intermediate signals as well which will be elaborated in subsequent discussion - particularly, the number and average velocity of cars passing through each traffic branch, calculated using sample algorithms.
